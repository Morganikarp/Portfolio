            <h2>This is the Whole Horse Page</h2>
            
            Whole Horse was a 2 player isometric puzzle game made by me and 8 others for the 2024 global game jam. For the team, I took the roles of project manager, programmer and 2d artist. My management role mainly involved cordinating and appointing work to other team members, and making sure work was being completed in a timely manner. For programming, I was responsible for the file and menu systems, as well as the objective list and trigger systems. I also collaborated on the player controller and the central grabbing and player merging mechanic. My artist role consisted of the objective list. Working in a larger team for a game jam was fun, and I enjoyed taking a leader role. I hope it is something I can do more in the future.
Below is a link to GitHub archive for the projects code, and this is a link to the GGJ page, where the game can be downloaded: https://globalgamejam.org/games/2024/whole-horse-9
