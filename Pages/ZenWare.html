            ZenWare was made for a 2 week long game jam as part of my first year of university. Its based off of the WarioWare games, and features microgames that must be completed in quick succession. The microgames are presented inside of a mask, that will grow and shrink in time with the music as a visual indicator of how long left the player has to complete the micro game. It was made using Unity engine and C#. Alongside the programming and design, I also made all the art for the game. Aside from the music, it was made by me alone.
