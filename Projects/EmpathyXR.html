            <div class="ProjectText">
                Near the end of my 3rd year at Portsmouth Uni, a lecturer reached out to me with an oppotunity to do some paid freelance work. 
                The client was a medical lecturer who was interested in the development of a simulation that granted the user some perspective on how people with certain conditions percieve the world, to aid in student education. 
                <br><br>
                The simulation can be played with on a keyboard or in VR, either of which puts the user in a GP surgery, and guides them with simple prompts until they reach their room. 
                There is a branching path throughout the simulation that allows the simulation to respond to how the player is acting. 
                The central mechanic of the simulation presents itself at the start, as a list of medical conditions. 
                Each condition can be enabled and scaled individually, which would then have a relevant effect on the player's experience during the rest of the simulation.
                <br><br>
                This project aimed to deliver a reasonable prototype, and development lasted 2 full months. 
                As the sole programmer on the team of 4, I was assigned the title of Lead Technician. 
                It was developed in Unreal engine, using Perforce for version control.
